#ENTITY_GATE_SWAP_GROUP
Defines whether a gate can be swapped with other gates of the same unit.

Gates in swap group 0 can't be swapped at all.

Gates in a nonzero swap group can be swapped with other gates of the same swap group and unit.

#ENTITY_GATE_SUFFIX
Suffix that gets appended to the reference designator, for example U101B.

Leave blank for single-gate entities. Use A,B,C,â€¦ for multi-gate entities.

If there's a gate dedicated to power supply, its suffix should be P.

#ENTITY_GATE_NAME
If there's only a single gate, its name should be "Main".

#UNIT_PIN_ALT_NAMES
If a pin has multiple functions, add these here, separated by spaces.

For example: Pin name: PB0, alternate names: I2C0_SDA ADC2_IN.
